**Reliability-aware emergency routing for Connected Autonomous Vehicles under large-scale infrastructure disruption**

*Fully reproducible research framework accompanying our Reliability Engineering & System Safety manuscript.*

---

## Overview

This repository presents a complete research framework for reliability-aware routing of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) operating in post-disaster transportation networks.

Unlike conventional vehicle routing approaches that assume a fully functional road and communication network, this framework explicitly models network reliability degradation and investigates how communication failures influence emergency medical service quality.

The framework integrates:

- Reliability-aware transportation network modeling
- Emergency vehicle routing with fuzzy time windows
- Multi-objective optimization
- Large-scale simulation
- Real-world disaster validation
- Automated publication-quality visualization

Every figure, table, animation, and report presented in the manuscript can be reproduced directly from this repository.

## Why this research?

Future autonomous transportation systems depend on reliable Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication.

During disasters such as widespread power outages, earthquakes, floods, or cyber-attacks, communication reliability rapidly deteriorates, reducing network connectivity and increasing travel delays.

This project investigates:

- How transportation network reliability affects emergency service quality.
- The critical reliability threshold where system performance collapses.
- Whether reliability-aware routing improves patient service rates.
- Which optimization algorithms perform best under degraded infrastructure.

## Scientific Contributions

- Reliability-aware CAV routing formulation with fuzzy time windows.
- Three-objective optimization balancing service quality, travel distance, and route reliability.
- Comprehensive benchmark of QiGA, GA, PSO, ALNS, TS, NSGA-II, and MOEA/D.
- Ten simulation experiments covering network degradation, fleet size, demand, priority, and algorithm performance.
- Real-world validation using the 2025 Iberian Peninsula blackout.
- Automated generation of publication-ready figures, tables, reports, MATLAB figures, and GIF animations.

## Major Findings

| Finding | Observation |
|----------|-------------|
| Critical threshold | φ ≈ 0.82–0.85 marks rapid service collapse |
| Reliability-aware routing | Improves service rate by 18–35 percentage points |
| Fleet expansion | Cannot compensate for severely degraded networks |
| Priority routing | Protects critical patients during disruption |
| Best SOO | QiGA |
| Best MOO | MOEA/D |
| Hub failures | Produce substantially greater disruption than random failures |

---

## Case Study

The framework is validated using the **2025 Iberian Peninsula Blackout**.

The Madrid transportation network is reconstructed from OpenStreetMap and evaluated under four disruption scenarios representing the progression of the blackout.

The results demonstrate that reliability-aware routing substantially improves emergency medical service during severe infrastructure degradation.
